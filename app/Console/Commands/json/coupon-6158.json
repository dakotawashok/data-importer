It&amp;#8217;s an expression of respect to all Georgian friends of the restaurant founders and an invitation to all their Moscow friends.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to legend, &amp;#8220;Nani&amp;#8221; is the name of the Georgian elusive beauty, everyone talks about, but no one saw. The chef, Elena Dikovskaya gathered within the menu of Nani, the best dishes of Transcaucasia, without any snobbery or fake gourmet. Colourful phali balls, gentle satzivi, neat khinkali, gold khachapuri, fragrant chashushuli and flavorous shashliki just from grill &ndash; the georgian cuisine in Moscow is more relevant than ever today.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The dessert, as always in Restaurant Syndicate&nbsp;is worth a separate visit. The pastry chef Victor Averkov invented a half-dozen curious author dishes based on Georgian recipes: goat cheese with figs, berry khachapuri, airy suluguni with cornel berry sauce, ac jelly of goat cheese, and an apricot cake with chacha.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;To receive this offer,&nbsp;please inform staff&nbsp;that the payment will be made via Diners Club card and you want to redeem a 10% discount through Diners Club Privileges.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Offer cannot be combined with other promotions, offers, or discount cards.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n","locations":"&lt;p&gt;20, Malaya Dmitrovka street.&lt;br \/&gt;\nMoscow, Russia&lt;br \/&gt;\n+7 495 915 84 74&lt;br \/&gt;\n+7 985 769 93 87&lt;br \/&gt;\n&lt;a title=&quot;Website&quot; href=&quot;http:\/\/www.restsindikat.com\/restaurants\/nani\/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Website&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Open from 12:00pm until 00:00&lt;\/p&gt;\n","company_email":"","company_phone_number":"","company_website":""},"offer_destination":[{"name":"Russia","slug":"russia","term_id":265,"term_taxonomy_id":266},{"name":"Moscow","slug":"moscow","term_id":304,"term_taxonomy_id":305,"parent":265}],"offer_tags":[{"name":"Dining","slug":"dine","term_id":6,"term_taxonomy_id":6}],"slider_coupons":[{"name":"Carousel Coupon","slug":"carousel-coupon","term_id":11,"term_taxonomy_id":11}],"remote_sites":[{"name":"Diners Club Privileges","slug":"dinersclubprivileges","term_id":240,"term_taxonomy_id":240}],"featured":[],"offer_sticky_option":false,"geo_location":{"address":"ulitsa Malaya Dmitrovka, 20, Moskva, Russia, 127006","lat":55.7719243,"lng":37.6049533},"geolocation_v2":[{"address":"ulitsa Malaya Dmitrovka, 20, Moskva, Russia, 127006","body":"20 Malaya Dmitrovka street, Moscow","correctedAddress":"ulitsa Malaya Dmitrovka, 20, Moskva, Russia, 127006","iconid":null,"point":{"lat":55.7719243,"lng":37.6049533},"poly":null,"kml":null,"title":"","type":null,"viewport":{"sw":{"lat":55.770575319708,"lng":37.603604319709},"ne":{"lat":55.773273280291,"lng":37.606302280292}},"postid":null,"url":null}],"price_range":"","small_business":0,"cuisine_type":""}
