Our company completely restored a former merchant&amp;#8217;s residence that is now home to the restaurant. The mercantile furnishings of the restaurant have the feel of theatrical decorations &ndash; Oblomov is the place where you forget about time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Indeed, genuine mercantile furnishings are a very rare sight in modern day Moscow. The decorations &ndash; old knick-knacks, furniture and curios, including sideboards, pictures in heavy frames, ornate mirrors, chests of drawers and even an old typewriter &ndash; were collected across Russia and then lovingly restored.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Guests can choose a table on one of three floors. Awaiting you on the first, is a charming coffee house serving divine coffee which we roast ourselves. The second floor is divided into two rooms &amp;#8211; Shtolz and Oblomov, where Russian and European dishes are served. On the third floor is the Eastern Room, where guests can smoke hookahs, read and play cards. A summer garden is always open during the warmer months of the year &ndash; we offer dishes cooked on a traditional Russian barbecue and in an authentic Russian stove.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hps&quot;&gt;To receive this offer,&nbsp;&lt;\/span&gt;inform the administrator &lt;span class=&quot;hps&quot;&gt;that the&lt;\/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hps&quot;&gt;payment will be made&lt;\/span&gt; via &lt;span class=&quot;hps&quot;&gt;Diners Club card and&lt;span class=&quot;hps&quot;&gt; you want to redeem&nbsp;a 10% discount through Diners Club Privileges&lt;\/span&gt;.&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Offer cannot be combined with other promotions, offers, or discount cards.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\n","locations":"&lt;p&gt;1st Monetchikovskiy pereulok 5&lt;br \/&gt;\nMoscow, Russia&lt;br \/&gt;\n+7 (495) 953 68 28&lt;br \/&gt;\n&lt;a title=&quot;Website&quot; href=&quot;http:\/\/www.restsindikat.com\/restaurants\/%20oblomov\/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Website&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Open from 12.00-05.00&lt;\/p&gt;\n","company_email":"","company_phone_number":"","company_website":""},"offer_destination":[{"name":"Russia","slug":"russia","term_id":265,"term_taxonomy_id":266},{"name":"Moscow","slug":"moscow","term_id":304,"term_taxonomy_id":305,"parent":265}],"offer_tags":[{"name":"Dining","slug":"dine","term_id":6,"term_taxonomy_id":6}],"slider_coupons":[{"name":"Carousel Coupon","slug":"carousel-coupon","term_id":11,"term_taxonomy_id":11}],"remote_sites":[{"name":"Diners Club Privileges","slug":"dinersclubprivileges","term_id":240,"term_taxonomy_id":240}],"featured":[],"offer_sticky_option":false,"geo_location":{"address":"5-y Monetchikovskiy pereulok, 5, Moskva, Russia, 115054","lat":55.7322459,"lng":37.6328579},"geolocation_v2":[{"address":"5-y Monetchikovskiy pereulok, 5, Moskva, Russia, 115054","body":"1st Monetchikovskiy pereulok 5, moscow","correctedAddress":"5-y Monetchikovskiy pereulok, 5, Moskva, Russia, 115054","iconid":null,"point":{"lat":55.7322459,"lng":37.6328579},"poly":null,"kml":null,"title":"","type":null,"viewport":{"sw":{"lat":55.730896919708,"lng":37.631508919709},"ne":{"lat":55.733594880291,"lng":37.634206880292}},"postid":null,"url":null}],"price_range":"","small_business":0,"cuisine_type":""}
