From a private alley entrance, an elegant clientele enters the space to a unique setting where seating is in the center of the room rather than along the perimeter. An extensive list of champagnes by the glass or bottle, champagne cocktails, and even large format bottles are just part of the appeal. Bottle service compromises a full selection of top brands as well as a cocktail list.
