As one of the most striking locations on Lake Garda, Riva was chosen as the holiday retreat of the Hapsburg Royal Family, the upper middle class, artists and philosophers &amp;#8211; the hotel was pervaded by the allure of the Belle Epoque.&lt;br \/&gt;\nAfter an accurate refurbishment, the Lido Palace&rsquo;s liberty style has been brought back &amp;#8211; restored, polished and enhanced by the contrast of resins, metal and glass. The hotel once gain is offering a discrete sense of luxury, contemporary designed guestrooms and suites with striking views of lake and surrounding mountains, two restaurants, a state-of-the-art Spa Centoundici (CXI), and two heated swimming pools.
