Chef Fabio Picchi has earned accolades for his traditional but refined Florentine cooking, notably excluding pasta from the menu. While the menu changes often, some of his dishes have become classics and remain on the menu, such as Potato and ricotta Flan with Meat Sauce Ragu; Florentine Terrine of Chicken and Rabbit Liver with Spinach and Parmigiano; Salt Cod Brandade&nbsp;alla Cassi and a lovely Cheesecake with Bitter Orange Marmalade to conclude.
