From former castles and palaces, to urban gems, mountain hideaways and private islands, our collection of more than 375 uncommon luxury hotels in 75 countries are united not by what makes them the same, but by the remarkable details that make them different.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nestled among 500 acres in the Montecito foothills of Southern California&rsquo;s wine country, San Ysidro Ranch has provided a tranquil vacation destination for discriminating travelers for over a century. Guests are drawn to the Santa Barbara hideaway for its blend of natural beauty, romantic heritage and classic luxury. Individually decorated private cottages and suites wind along San Ysidro&rsquo;s hillside creek and tree-lined paths. Built in classic bungalow style, guest accommodations feature hot tubs on private outdoor patios with outdoor rain fall showers, hand-cut stone or Old World masonry fireplaces, radiant-heated bathroom floors, and hand-selected antique furnishings.
