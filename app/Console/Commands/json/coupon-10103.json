From former castles and palaces, to urban gems, mountain hideaways and private islands, our collection of more than 375 uncommon luxury hotels in 75 countries are united not by what makes them the same, but by the remarkable details that make them different.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Located in the former Morning Post newspaper building designed by star-architects Charles Mewes and Arthur Davis, One Aldwych is a stunning hotel with a striking contemporary design. Ideally located in the heart of London&rsquo;s theatre district, it is a short walk from the shops and restaurants of the capital&rsquo;s bustling West End and close to the financial district. In-house restaurant Axis at One Aldwych draws a large number of guests and locals for its Modern British menu, as does Indigo restaurant with its Modern European food. Overnight guests can relax in the new and private Lounge at One. Another highlight is the double height Lobby Bar, named one of the top five hotel bars in the world by The Sunday Telegraph; it is a buzzing hot spot where those in-the-know order the signature Gin &amp;amp; Tonic Martini.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diners Club cardmembers must first visit&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https:\/\/www.lhw.com\/online-offers\/DCI?ppcode=DCI&amp;#038;pocode=1512NBR&amp;#038;ext=DNCLWEBLC16&amp;#038;utm_medium=link&amp;#038;utm_source=dnclweblc&amp;#038;utm_campaign=2016dnclweblc&amp;#038;utm_content=dncllcweb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this link&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to enroll in Leaders Club&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After enrolling in Leaders Club, cardmembers can take advantage of the following benefits when staying at a Leading Hotel:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Daily continental breakfast for two&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;One-category room upgrade (subject to availability)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Earn one complimentary night at any Leading Hotel for every five qualifying stays completed&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Early check-in, late check-out consideration (based on availability)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Free internet access&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Unique welcome gift&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making a Reservation&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br \/&gt; In order to obtain all benefits available through membership in Leaders Club, Diners Club cardmembers must make hotel reservations through one of the booking channels listed below, and must also provide his or her Leaders Club membership number at the time of booking:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Through The Leading Hotels of the World &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.lhw.com\/property.aspx?pid=0A66DBB8-2277-4B25-9D63-46E1B008C1AA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;(no other web-enabled booking engine qualifies for this eligibility requirement)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Through an&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/lhw.com\/customer-care&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LHW Worldwide Reservations and Service Center&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Through the Loyalty Program, as provided on the back of the membership card&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hotel reservations made directly with one of LHW&rsquo;s member hotels will not be eligible for the benefits of Leaders Club.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Check the specific terms for canceling a reservation, as each hotel has a different policy.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Membership in the Loyalty Program and Loyalty Program benefits are subject to the Leaders Club Terms &amp;#038; Conditions.
