The intimate Scandinavian-style dining room is decorated with parquet floors, light oak tables, banquette seating and custom touches everywhere, including ceramics designed by Chef Lusted himself.&nbsp; Ross Lusted&rsquo;s cuisine has been influenced by his travels in Asia with many of his dishes ash-grilled or slow smoked over binchotan charcoal on his Robata grill. His unique flavour pairings and technique earned him Good Food Guide&rsquo;s &ldquo;Chef of the Year,&rdquo; The Australian&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hottest Chef,&rdquo; and Four Chef&rsquo;s Hats Gault Millau Guide 2014. The menu constantly evolves according to the seasons and you will experience dishes such as wild caught raw snapper with preserved watermelon peel, salted lemon and red grapefruit or main courses such Ash-grilled duck, blueberries, caramelized pear puree, aged vinegar and mulberry powder; or crisp skinned Murray cod, black vinegar and Teochew sauce with cloud ear mushrooms and new season ginger. Dessert at The Bridge Room is a must-have so try Lusted&rsquo;s acclaimed whipped black sesame served with toasted sesame powder, melon, puffed rice and coconut sugar.
