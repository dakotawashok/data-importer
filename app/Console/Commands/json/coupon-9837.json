Built in 1858, the Grand Hotel Barri&rsquo;re is all about celebrating this seaside enclave. Its location is stunning, looking across the bay towards the fortified city of St. Malo. Coastal elegance inspired the sumptuous interiors done by French star designer, Jacques Garcia who managed to merge the opulence of the building&rsquo;s Second Empire facade with true 21st-century comforts. For lunchtime, many guests and locals flock to the hotel&rsquo;s 333 Cafe, which serves up light dishes on a terrace with stunning sea views.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diners Club cardmembers must first visit&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https:\/\/www.lhw.com\/online-offers\/DCI?ppcode=DCI&amp;amp;pocode=1512NBR&amp;amp;ext=DNCLWEBLC16&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_source=dnclweblc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2016dnclweblc&amp;amp;utm_content=dncllcweb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this link&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to enroll in Leaders Club&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After enrolling in Leaders Club, cardmembers can take advantage of the following benefits when staying at a Leading Hotel:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Daily continental breakfast for two&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;One-category room upgrade (subject to availability)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Earn one complimentary night at any Leading Hotel for every five qualifying stays completed&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Early check-in, late check-out consideration (based on availability)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Free internet access&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Unique welcome gift&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making a Reservation&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;\nIn order to obtain all benefits available through membership in Leaders Club, Diners Club cardmembers must make hotel reservations through one of the booking channels listed below, and must also provide his or her Leaders Club membership number at the time of booking:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Through The Leading Hotels of the World &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.lhw.com\/property.aspx?pid=155AF383-0488-43B3-B451-909082820528&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;(no other web-enabled booking engine qualifies for this eligibility requirement)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Through an&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/lhw.com\/customer-care&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LHW Worldwide Reservations and Service Center&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Through the Loyalty Program, as provided on the back of the membership card&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hotel reservations made directly with one of LHW&rsquo;s member hotels will not be eligible for the benefits of Leaders Club.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Check the specific terms for canceling a reservation, as each hotel has a different policy.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Membership in the Loyalty Program and Loyalty Program benefits are subject to the Leaders Club Terms &amp;amp; Conditions.
