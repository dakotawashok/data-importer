From former castles and palaces, to urban gems, mountain hideaways and private islands, our collection of more than 375 uncommon luxury hotels in 75 countries are united not by what makes them the same, but by the remarkable details that make them different.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Those seeking rest and relaxation need look no further than the Chateau Hotel de la Messardiere, a 19th-century castle perched on a quiet hillside overlooking the stunning Bay of Pampelonne. Just three minutes from the village center, the Chateau is a peaceful sanctuary where guests can bask in a home away-fromhome atmosphere while pulsing to the Saint-Tropez beat from a distance. The famously warm climate can be enjoyed from the almost Olympic-size outdoor swimming pool and Open Sky, the poolside restaurant overlooking the beautiful Bay of Saint-Tropez, or at the private sand beach Tropezina, just a few hundred meters from the hotel. Those in need of some action can hop aboard the hotel&rsquo;s twenty-four-hour shuttle, which transports guests to the buzzing resort town.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diners Club cardmembers must first visit&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https:\/\/www.lhw.com\/online-offers\/DCI?ppcode=DCI&amp;#038;pocode=1512NBR&amp;#038;ext=DNCLWEBLC16&amp;#038;utm_medium=link&amp;#038;utm_source=dnclweblc&amp;#038;utm_campaign=2016dnclweblc&amp;#038;utm_content=dncllcweb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this link&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to enroll in Leaders Club&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After enrolling in Leaders Club, cardmembers can take advantage of the following benefits when staying at a Leading Hotel:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Daily continental breakfast for two&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;One-category room upgrade (subject to availability)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Earn one complimentary night at any Leading Hotel for every five qualifying stays completed&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Early check-in, late check-out consideration (based on availability)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Free internet access&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Unique welcome gift&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making a Reservation&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br \/&gt; In order to obtain all benefits available through membership in Leaders Club, Diners Club cardmembers must make hotel reservations through one of the booking channels listed below, and must also provide his or her Leaders Club membership number at the time of booking:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Through The Leading Hotels of the World &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.lhw.com\/property.aspx?pid=EEE6FCB4-DE9F-4014-ABD7-768C82DD42EC&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;(no other web-enabled booking engine qualifies for this eligibility requirement)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Through an&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/lhw.com\/customer-care&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LHW Worldwide Reservations and Service Center&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Through the Loyalty Program, as provided on the back of the membership card&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hotel reservations made directly with one of LHW&rsquo;s member hotels will not be eligible for the benefits of Leaders Club.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Check the specific terms for canceling a reservation, as each hotel has a different policy.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Membership in the Loyalty Program and Loyalty Program benefits are subject to the Leaders Club Terms &amp;#038; Conditions.
