Thanks to the huge panoramic windows overlooking Moscow, there is a lot of light&nbsp;that abounds. Through the use of high-quality natural materials, the space is quite reserved about colours, but very cozy and comfortable, the main message throughout the&nbsp;restaurant.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, the essence of the restaurant is gastronomy! The chef, like a fashion designer, has created a menu featuring a collection of flavors and dishes, sampled&nbsp;in different parts of the world, and presented in the author&amp;#8217;s presentation of Anatoly.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Gastronom is the perfect place for daily visits, whether its a business meeting, a date with a loved one or a meeting of good friends!&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hps&quot;&gt;To receive this offer, please&nbsp;inform your server that the payment will be made with your Diners Club card&nbsp;and you want to redeem a 10% discount through Diners Club Privileges.&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Offer cannot be combined with other promotions or offers or discount card.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n","locations":"&lt;p&gt;36, bld.3, Noviy Arbat&lt;br \/&gt;\n(Sopping Mall Ffera, 3d floor)&lt;br \/&gt;\nMoscow, Russia&lt;br \/&gt;\n+7 495 690 73 73&lt;br \/&gt;\n&lt;a title=&quot;Website&quot; href=&quot;http:\/\/www.restsindikat.com\/restaurants\/gastronom\/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Website&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\n","company_email":"","company_phone_number":"","company_website":""},"offer_destination":[{"name":"Russia","slug":"russia","term_id":265,"term_taxonomy_id":266},{"name":"Moscow","slug":"moscow","term_id":304,"term_taxonomy_id":305,"parent":265}],"offer_tags":[{"name":"Dining","slug":"dine","term_id":6,"term_taxonomy_id":6}],"slider_coupons":[{"name":"Carousel Coupon","slug":"carousel-coupon","term_id":11,"term_taxonomy_id":11}],"remote_sites":[],"featured":[],"offer_sticky_option":false,"geo_location":{"address":"Arbat District, Moscow, Russia","lat":55.751,"lng":37.59},"geolocation_v2":[{"address":"Arbat District, Moscow, Russia","body":"36 bld.3, Noviy Arbat, moscow","correctedAddress":"Arbat District, Moscow, Russia","iconid":null,"point":{"lat":55.751,"lng":37.59},"poly":null,"kml":null,"title":"","type":null,"viewport":{"sw":{"lat":55.7439149,"lng":37.5719069},"ne":{"lat":55.75822,"lng":37.6119531}},"postid":null,"url":null}],"price_range":"","small_business":0,"cuisine_type":""}
