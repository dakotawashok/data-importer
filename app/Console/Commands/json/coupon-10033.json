From former castles and palaces, to urban gems, mountain hideaways and private islands, our collection of more than 375 uncommon luxury hotels in 75 countries are united not by what makes them the same, but by the remarkable details that make them different.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On some days during the three years it took to restore Marrakech&rsquo;s undisputed grandedame hotel, more than 1,000 craftsmen were at work on the site. Parisian designer Jacques Garcia, entrusted with returning the 1923 property to its former glory, sought out the city&rsquo;s most talented painters and wood carvers. The craftsmen he chose laid millions of hand-cut tiles, pieced together wood-marquetry walls, carved ornate designs into plaster columns and forged hundreds of handmade lanterns. Thanks to them, the palace is once again a vibrant celebration of the city&rsquo;s past, present and future, displaying Moroccan style, complete with intricate patterns and arabesques based on Berber and Arab-Andalusian traditions.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diners Club cardmembers must first visit&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https:\/\/www.lhw.com\/online-offers\/DCI?ppcode=DCI&amp;#038;pocode=1512NBR&amp;#038;ext=DNCLWEBLC16&amp;#038;utm_medium=link&amp;#038;utm_source=dnclweblc&amp;#038;utm_campaign=2016dnclweblc&amp;#038;utm_content=dncllcweb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this link&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to enroll in Leaders Club&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After enrolling in Leaders Club, cardmembers can take advantage of the following benefits when staying at a Leading Hotel:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Daily continental breakfast for two&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;One-category room upgrade (subject to availability)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Earn one complimentary night at any Leading Hotel for every five qualifying stays completed&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Early check-in, late check-out consideration (based on availability)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Free internet access&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Unique welcome gift&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making a Reservation&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br \/&gt; In order to obtain all benefits available through membership in Leaders Club, Diners Club cardmembers must make hotel reservations through one of the booking channels listed below, and must also provide his or her Leaders Club membership number at the time of booking:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Through The Leading Hotels of the World &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.lhw.com\/property.aspx?pid=8A073291-3EBC-4190-AE3A-DD1C7C7C5599&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;(no other web-enabled booking engine qualifies for this eligibility requirement)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Through an&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/lhw.com\/customer-care&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LHW Worldwide Reservations and Service Center&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Through the Loyalty Program, as provided on the back of the membership card&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hotel reservations made directly with one of LHW&rsquo;s member hotels will not be eligible for the benefits of Leaders Club.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Check the specific terms for canceling a reservation, as each hotel has a different policy.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Membership in the Loyalty Program and Loyalty Program benefits are subject to the Leaders Club Terms &amp;#038; Conditions.
