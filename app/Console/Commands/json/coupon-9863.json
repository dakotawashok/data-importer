From former castles and palaces, to urban gems, mountain hideaways and private islands, our collection of more than 375 uncommon luxury hotels in 75 countries are united not by what makes them the same, but by the remarkable details that make them different.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rich in history and tradition, the more than 130 year old Grand Hotel Stockholm occupies prime position on the city&rsquo;s waterfront, a timeless classic that has played a pivotal role in shaping Stockholm as the cosmopolitan city that it is today. One of Scandinavia&rsquo;s leading luxury hotels, Grand Hotel Stockholm has borne witness to some of the world&rsquo;s greatest achievements, and to this day, continues to makes its presence felt far beyond its shores. Since 1901, the Nobel Prize laureates and their families have all been guests of the Grand Hotel Stockholm and the list of royalty, heads of state and artists who have stayed is impressive. In the words of a famous past guest, &amp;#8220;The Grand is where it happens.&amp;#8221;&lt;br \/&gt;\nGrand Hotel offers impressive rooms and suites. The Princess Lilian Suite, with its 330 sqm and a panoramic view over Stockholm, is the most spectacular of them all. The Flag Suite and the Nobel Suite too are renowned, both with an astounding view from the 7th floor. All individually designed, each room has its own distinctive character and colorful history.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diners Club cardmembers must first visit&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https:\/\/www.lhw.com\/online-offers\/DCI?ppcode=DCI&amp;amp;pocode=1512NBR&amp;amp;ext=DNCLWEBLC16&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_source=dnclweblc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2016dnclweblc&amp;amp;utm_content=dncllcweb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this link&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to enroll in Leaders Club&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After enrolling in Leaders Club, cardmembers can take advantage of the following benefits when staying at a Leading Hotel:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Daily continental breakfast for two&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;One-category room upgrade (subject to availability)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Earn one complimentary night at any Leading Hotel for every five qualifying stays completed&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Early check-in, late check-out consideration (based on availability)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Free internet access&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Unique welcome gift&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making a Reservation&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;\nIn order to obtain all benefits available through membership in Leaders Club, Diners Club cardmembers must make hotel reservations through one of the booking channels listed below, and must also provide his or her Leaders Club membership number at the time of booking:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Through The Leading Hotels of the World &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.lhw.com\/property.aspx?pid=09586D84-F8E5-49ED-BAB6-530C54692F3E&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;(no other web-enabled booking engine qualifies for this eligibility requirement)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Through an&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/lhw.com\/customer-care&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LHW Worldwide Reservations and Service Center&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Through the Loyalty Program, as provided on the back of the membership card&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hotel reservations made directly with one of LHW&rsquo;s member hotels will not be eligible for the benefits of Leaders Club.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Check the specific terms for canceling a reservation, as each hotel has a different policy.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Membership in the Loyalty Program and Loyalty Program benefits are subject to the Leaders Club Terms &amp;amp; Conditions.
