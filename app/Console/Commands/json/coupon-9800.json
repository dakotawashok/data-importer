From former castles and palaces, to urban gems, mountain hideaways and private islands, our collection of more than 375 uncommon luxury hotels in 75 countries are united not by what makes them the same, but by the remarkable details that make them different.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Set on twenty acres of landscaped gardens overlooking Mirabello Bay, on Crete&rsquo;s northeast coast, the Elounda Bay Palace is a haven for watersports aficionados. There is a fully equipped activities center offering sailing, water-skiing, windsurfing, jet skiing and scuba-diving excursions. For a more relaxed pace, the resort features private sand beaches, several swimming pools and the al fresco lunch restaurant, Ariadne Tavern. The sparkling panorama takes center stage at the open-air Sail-In Bar. Families traveling with kids will appreciate the many childfriendly activities, and a dedicated pool where junior guests can play.
