The restaurant menu includes such hits of the era as famous salads like &amp;#8220;Capital&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Mimosa&amp;#8221;, dressed herring, pies and pancakes with various fillings, dumplings, cabbage rolls, Pozharskaya chicken cutlet, Minister&rsquo;s schnitzel, ice cream and many other delicious offerings.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The interior uses high Soviet style as the designer, Helen Turin planned. But rather than making an exact replica, it gives a feel and atmosphere of the times, giving guests an overall and eclectic visual experience. Much of this comes from the classicism and empire periods. Every detail of the interior creates a sense of comfort and returns us to the good old days, creating the atmosphere of warm and pleasant nostalgia, which we feel when watching old Soviet movies.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hps&quot;&gt;To receive this offer, please &lt;\/span&gt;inform the administrator &lt;span class=&quot;hps&quot;&gt;that the&lt;\/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hps&quot;&gt;payment will be made&lt;\/span&gt; via &lt;span class=&quot;hps&quot;&gt;Diners Club card and&lt;span class=&quot;hps&quot;&gt; you want to redeem a&nbsp;10% discount through Diners Club Privileges&lt;\/span&gt;.&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Offer cannot be combined with other promotions, offers, or discount cards.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n","locations":"&lt;p&gt;Bolshoy Patriarshiy pereulok,&nbsp;7&lt;br \/&gt;\nMoscow, Russia&lt;br \/&gt;\n+7 (495) 697-51-10&lt;br \/&gt;\n&lt;a title=&quot;Website&quot; href=&quot;http:\/\/www.restsindikat.com\/restaurants\/pavilion\/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Website&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Open from&nbsp;12:00 &amp;#8211; 00:00&lt;\/p&gt;\n","company_email":"","company_phone_number":"","company_website":""},"offer_destination":[{"name":"Russia","slug":"russia","term_id":265,"term_taxonomy_id":266},{"name":"Moscow","slug":"moscow","term_id":304,"term_taxonomy_id":305,"parent":265}],"offer_tags":[{"name":"Dining","slug":"dine","term_id":6,"term_taxonomy_id":6}],"slider_coupons":[{"name":"Carousel Coupon","slug":"carousel-coupon","term_id":11,"term_taxonomy_id":11}],"remote_sites":[{"name":"Diners Club Privileges","slug":"dinersclubprivileges","term_id":240,"term_taxonomy_id":240}],"featured":[],"offer_sticky_option":false,"geo_location":{"address":"Bolshoy Patriarshiy pereulok, 7, Moskva, Russia, 123001","lat":55.7632502,"lng":37.5930088},"geolocation_v2":[{"address":"Bolshoy Patriarshiy pereulok, 7, Moskva, Russia, 123001","body":"Russia, Moscow, Bolshoy Patriarshiy pereulok 7","correctedAddress":"Bolshoy Patriarshiy pereulok, 7, Moskva, Russia, 123001","iconid":null,"point":{"lat":55.7632502,"lng":37.5930088},"poly":null,"kml":null,"title":"","type":null,"viewport":{"sw":{"lat":55.761897169708,"lng":37.591665669708},"ne":{"lat":55.764595130291,"lng":37.594363630291}},"postid":null,"url":null}],"price_range":"","small_business":0,"cuisine_type":""}
